# UR Platform
Mainly a requests platform pieced together for use of UR CPU actions. It's derived from PHP-Login. There are no modifications to PHP-Login's core.  

## About / Why
We take on random requests and this makes it a breeze doing so. Currently members may place requests and review their status. An administrator may approve/deny requests (in a future update. Right now it's done via database). 

## What's this crappy code?
I'm not a programmer, I'm a solutionist. PHP-Login has made it extremely easy to make "UR Platform" and I'm happy it's progressing. Contribute where you feel it's necessary.

### Current features
```
- Sign up, forgot password, login, verify
- Place requests
```

To do: "admin" toggles.
